[Complex-valued convolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution#Domain_of_definition) could provide some interesting results in signal processing-based deep learning. A simple(-ish) idea is including explicit phase information of time series in neural networks. This code enables complex-valued convolution in convolutional neural networks in [keras](https://keras.io) with the [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org/) backend. This makes the network modular and interoperable with standard keras layers and operations.

This code is very much in **Alpha**. Please consider helping out improving the code to advance together. This repository is based on the code which reproduces experiments presented in the paper [Deep Complex Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09792). It is a port to Keras with Tensorflow-backend.

Requirements
------------

- numpy
- scipy
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow 2.X

Install requirements for computer vision experiments with pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Depending on your Python installation you might want to use anaconda or venv or other tools.


Installation
------------

```
pip install keras-complex
```

Usage
-----
Build your neural networks with the help of keras. 

``` 
import complexnn

import keras
from keras import models
from keras import layers
from keras import optimizers

model = models.Sequential()

model.add(complexnn.conv.ComplexConv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', input_shape=(28, 28, 2)))
model.add(complexnn.bn.ComplexBatchNormalization())
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2), padding='same'))

model.compile(optimizer=optimizers.Adam(), loss='mse')

```

An example working implementation of an autoencoder can be found [here](https://github.com/JesperDramsch/Complex-CNN-Seismic/).

Complex Format of Tensors
-------------------------

This library assumes that complex values are split into two real-valued parts. The real-valued and complex-valued complement, also seen [in the Docs](https://keras-complex.readthedocs.io/math.html).

The tensors for a 2D complex tensor of 3x3, the look like:

```
[[[r r r],
  [r r r],
  [r r r]],
  [i,i,i],
  [i,i,i],
  [i,i,i]]]
```

So multiple samples should then be arranged into `[r,r,r,i,i,i]`, which is also documented [in the Docs](https://keras-complex.readthedocs.io/math.html#implementation).
